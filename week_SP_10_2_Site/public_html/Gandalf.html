    - The Fellowship of the Ring, "A Long-expected Party"  </h3> <br>

                <p>Gandalf the Grey, later known as Gandalf the White, and originally named Ol√≥rin, was an Istar (wizard), sent by the West in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined Thorin and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, convoked the Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War of the Ring. </p>
